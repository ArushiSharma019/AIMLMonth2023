Summary(Optional) :   Honda vehicles have a high resale value because of their reputation for dependability, fuel efficiency, and overall quality. However, various factors such as                       model popularity, condition, mileage, maintenance history, market demand, and economic conditions can all have an impact on the resale value of a Honda                             vehicle. While Honda vehicles tend to keep their value well, individual resale prices might vary based on geography and market trends.
